# ðŸ’¡ Ideas

> A place to share cool ideas. Also, proof I can do thoda Next.js and GitHub Auth

This project was me testing what I actually absorbed after a Next.js (App Router) tutorial.

Built with:
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- NextAuth (GitHub)
- Sanity.io
- Framer Motion

Just a fun little brain-dump platform, styled dark, animated smooth, and running clean.
